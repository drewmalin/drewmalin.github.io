Notes, side projects, TODOs, how-tos.

A past attempt at a dev-log/dev-blog site resulted in this note-to-self:
> Action item: write shorter posts.

Let's do just that.

Most posts about projects will be short on prose. Instead, I'll tend to write notes and relevant descriptions of projects in the form of (heavily-commented and instantly-merged) PRs against those projects. This way I can go back in time and track my thinking as projects evolved, while constraining that thinking to the context of the code under modification.

This style of "note-taking" works well in my professional projects, so let's give it a go in my personal projects.
